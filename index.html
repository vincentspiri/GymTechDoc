            <p>In the past year going to the gym and eating healthy has become a very important part of my life. In fact I'd even say that it's my main hobby</p>
            <p>Exercising is very important for humans but it's also something that most of us lack the most.</p>

            <header>Why is working out important?</header>
            <p>Working out/exercising is important not only to keep your body functional and strong but also so that you can look good and feel confident.</p>
            <p>I used to weigh 114lbs in highschool and it's very hard to have self confidence when you're a scronny little kid that knows anyone can beat him in physical combat.</p>

            <header>How do I start?</header>
            <p>First you need to decide what you're going to workout for. If you're small and trying to bulk up then you should do less cardio and more weight lifting. If you're trying to lose weight then still do weight lifting but I would add in more cardio.</p>
            <p>Anyone can start working out at home. Before you read more of this you should stop and do 20 pushups. Try and do 100 today. Then try and run 5 miles tomorrow. It's hard to go wrong with basic exercises like pushups, pullups, and running.</p>
            <p>But if that's not enough and you want to start going to the gym then you're going to want to know a few more things.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Strength_training">
            <header>Strength training</header>
            <p>If you're trying to go the power lifting route and just focus on gaining strength, then you're going to want to use heavy weights for lower reps. The rep range I would target for each exercise is 5-10.</p>
            <p>But don't get cocky and go straight for the heaby weights, you're going to look like a fool. Use the light weights and learn the <a href="https://musclewiki.com/" target="_blank">proper form</a> first before you get injured.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Body_building">
            <header>Body building</header>
            <p>If your goal is to body build and get all the women then your target rep range is going to be 10-15. Of course with strength training and body building you're going to need <a href="https://musclewiki.com/" target="_blank">proper form</a> and to use progressive overload. Don't stay on the same weight for months. Always push as hard as you can. If you think you can't do another rep, go for another one.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_to_eat">
            <header>What to eat</header>
            <p>Believe it or not, your diet is 50% or more of your workout journey, especially at the beginning. If you're trying to gain weight then shoot for 3000+ calories per day. If you're trying to lose weight then don't go under 2000 per day. But the most important thing with dieting regardless of whether you're bulking or cutting is to STAY AWAY FROM SUGAR.</p>
            <p>Sugar you get from fruits are fine but when you look at the nutrition facts on the back and it says "added sugar 10g" you want to stay away from that. Ideally you're also hitting 100g of protein each day spread out throughout the day.</p>
            <p>Ideally you're also eating whole foods. What I mean by this is eating the raw ingredient of what ever is on the nutrition label. If the back of the nutrition label for a store bought burger says "onions, beef, garlic" then go home and cook some beef with onions and garlic.</p>
